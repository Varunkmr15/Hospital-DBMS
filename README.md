PROBLEM STATEMENT
Enfolding Hands Hospital believe in providing world class facilities to their customers as we generally in the hospitals there is infamously long queues to schedule an appointment or to collect the reports of a certain diagnosis etc. So in order to provide more facilities to the patients they want to build a system which provides all the necessary information such as number of beds available at the moment, in case of emergency you can directly book an ambulance and gives all the basic information about the hospital plus offers role based access so that the information provided to the user helps them access their data effectively and can also support online appointment booking. To support all of this the hospital will require a database which include the detail of hospital such as Name, ID (Unique),address, contact number, beds available along with this it should store all the information about the employees ID(unique), Name, contact no., Salary , Information about the patients such as Patient ID, Patient Name, Contact no, address , age , diagnosis etc , Doctors ID, Dept, Name, contact, qualification, Experience. It should also be able to handle all the details regarding the pharmacy and laboratory such as medicines available , their expiry date , price, quantity and test reports details such as test results etc. and also should handle the bill desk in order to store all the information about the payments, dues etc by keeping track of Bills ,ID, patients admission/discharge date etc. So in order to make hospital visit seamless and hassle free and also allowing access to the patients to check their details remotely would be a great effort to reduce data inaccuracy it helps in data security and accessibility and overall providing a better experience.
